Description:

I just completed BCG's GenAI on Forage. 

In the simulation:

 * Completed a job simulation involving AI-powered financial chatbot development
   for BCG's Gen-AI Consulting team.
 * Gained experience in Python programming, including the use of libraries such
   as pandas for data manipulation.
 * Integrated and interpreted complex financial data from 10-K and 10-Q reports,
   employing rule-based logic to create a chatbot that provides user-friendly
   financial insights and analysis.
